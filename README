CatHex is a Netcat tool that facilitates probing proprietary TCP and UDP services.

## Future

* Ability to enter input sent as hex
* Listen option to interact with custom-built clients
* Proper unit tests

## Test Server
Run the test server:
```
$ python server.py
```
In another terminal, connect to the test server using cathex:
```
$ cathex localhost 12345
```
